## Build With

- [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html), used for a component based setup. And the ability to manage states (scroll position, is item in view) easily.
- [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), for SSR. Overkill for what it is right now, but makes the page a Single Page Application and can add transitions between pages (notice how the menu fades away when you click a link inside of it).
- [SCSS]('https://sass-lang.com/guide') for creating variables inside CSS & breakpoints mixins.

## Thoughts

Forgive my messy code, 2 days is a very short time span but I think I did quite well on the end result. I would have loved to be more systematic but there wasn't a lot of time for refactoring.

Some minor bugs are still present. Nuxt is forcing me to use scoped css, and I'm not a huge fan of that so I'm confusing Nuxt in that sense. (Try to use the element inspector and see how the css gets super confused when you toggle a css-property on or off). I know what the issue is (scoped styling) but had no time to fix this anymore.

Overall I thought it was quite a challenging assignment, not too easy (weird sized fonts & odd layout components), but also not too hard. With more time I would probably have approached this with a more systematic approach, but also have a lot to learn, best practices wise.
